# -Defective-Rail-Classification-using-a-simple-CNN-and-VGG16-Based-Classifiers
Deep Learning based classifiers for broken rail detection

Two convolutional neural network models, a custom CNN and a VGG16 transfer learning based model, were 
trained on a dataset of defective and nondefective rails and their performance was 
evaluated, with the classification task treated as binary classification. The model based on 
VGG16 significantly outperformed the custom convolutional neural network with training 
times that were half the length. Convolutional Neural Networks with high performance 
could be used to create automatic defective rail detection systems that reduce or remove 
the need for manual identification of railway defects, which are a leading cause of railway 
accidents and deaths on railways worldwide.
